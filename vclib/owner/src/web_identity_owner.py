        Create a new Identity Owner

        ### Parameters
        - redirect_uris(`list[str]`): A list of redirect URIs to register with issuers.
        It is the caller's responsibility to ensure these match with the API.
        - cred_offer_endpoint(`str`): The credential offer URI, e.g.
        "https://example.com/offer". The routes for recieving credential offers, and
        redirecting the user to authorise based on a credential offer, are dynamically
        determined by parsing this URI with `urllib.parse.urlparse` and retrieving the
        path.
        - oauth_client_options(`dict = {}`): A dictionary containing optional overrides
        for the wallet's OAuth client info, used in registration of new clients. See
        `WalletClientMetadata` for accepted fields.
        Note that even if keys `"redirect_uris"` or `"credential_offer_endpoint"` are
        provided, they will be overwritten by their respective positional arguments.
