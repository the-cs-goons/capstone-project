    """
    Implementation of AbstractStorageProvider.

    ## NOTES ON DESIGN ##
    This implementation is designed for wallet implementations where the backend and
    the frontend run from the same device.

    Standard web authentication/authorization strategies become less useful in this
    use case, the goal of this storage provider is to write persistent data to disk
    in a safe-(r) manner. This is done by employing a singleton pattern for one
    active user at a time, and loading a transient SQLite database into memory
    containing the user's credentials. These are written to disk as an SQLite DB
    wrapped in a ZIP archive encrypted with AES, rather than standard ZIP encryption.
    This is because the encryption PKZIP supports has a couple of known weaknesses.

    If you want to unzip these files while developing, you will need to use 3rd party
    software such as 7-Zip, or simply opening up the Python3 interpreted and using
    the pyzipper module directly.

    A transient SQLite DB is being used rather than a file to minimise writes to disk
    of the unprotected credentials. This should, at minimum, prevent someone with
    access to the unlocked holder's device from simply finding the saved files in
    memory and extracting the credentials from within without needing to 'unlock' the
    wallet.
